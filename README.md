A new Flutter project.

# Assessment Quiz App

This Flutter project is a clean architecture implementation of an assessment quiz app using BLoC (Business Logic Component) for state management. The app loads assessment categories, top picks, and recently taken quizzes from a JSON file using a repository pattern.

## Overview

The Assessment Quiz App allows users to view various quiz categories, take quizzes from the "Top Picks" section, and view recently taken quizzes. The data is fetched from a JSON file that simulates an API response.

The main focus of this app is to demonstrate clean architecture principles, BLoC pattern for state management, and repository pattern for data handling.


## Features

- Quiz Categories: Displays a list of categories with icons and the number of quizzes available.
- Top Picks: Showcases a curated list of recommended quizzes.
- Recently Taken: Displays a list of quizzes the user has recently taken.
- State Management: Uses BLoC for efficient state management and separation of concerns.
- Repository Pattern: Decouples the data layer from the business logic.
- JSON Data: Data is fetched from a JSON file simulating an API call.


## Architecture

This app follows Clean Architecture principles, which divides the app into three main layers:

1. Presentation Layer: Contains the UI and BLoC logic for interacting with the user interface.
2. Domain Layer: Contains business logic and the entities used in the app.
3. Data Layer: Responsible for data handling (e.g., fetching the JSON data simulating an API).

## Technologies Used

- Flutter: Frontend framework for building cross-platform applications.
- Dart: Programming language for Flutter development.
- BLoC: For state management, ensuring separation of concerns and reactivity.
- Clean Architecture: For organizing code into clear layers with separation of concerns.
- Repository Pattern: For abstracting data access and decoupling it from business logic.
- JSON: For handling data like categories and quizzes in a format simulating API responses.



## Future Improvements

1. API Integration: Replace the local JSON file with actual API calls.
2. User Authentication: Add user login and progress tracking for completed quizzes.
3. Quiz Completion: Implement actual quiz-taking functionality.
4. Dark Mode: Provide a theme switcher to enable dark mode.
5. Caching: Add offline data caching for a better user experience.
